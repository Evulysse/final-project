# Final Project Travel Planner

In this project, you'll use a web application to plan a trip. 

With it you are able to choose from a selection of destinations and then type in activies of interest. 

Multiple lists can be displayed at the same time frame for different location.


 **Your app has at least three distinct "features"**
  
  *Uses a function to compile countries and dates
  *Uses a function to create plans
  *Uses a function to add, edit, and delete activities
